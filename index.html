Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is create an HTML5 drawing canvas with a border that has buttons that can draw a rectange, put my name on the canvas, load an image, and clears the canvas. 
 
Known Issues:
Sometimes you may have to press draw image twice in order for it to load, but I'm unsure if that's just my computer. Otherwise, there are no issues!
